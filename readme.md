## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([retext][]) plugin to check readability: whether
your presumed target audience can read your prose.
It applies [Daleâ€”Chall][dale-chall],
[Automated Readability][automated-readability], [Coleman-Liau][], [Flesch][],
[Gunning-Fog][], [SMOG][], and [Spache][].

## When should I use this?

You can use this plugin when youâ€™re dealing with content that might be
difficult to read to some folks, and have authors that can fix that content.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: I also made an online, editable, demo, similar to this project:
> [`wooorm.com/readability`](https://wooorm.com/readability/).

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install retext-readability
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import retextReadability from 'https://esm.sh/retext-readability@7'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import retextReadability from 'https://esm.sh/retext-readability@7?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

Say our document `example.txt` contains:

```txt
The cat sat on the mat

The constellation also contains an isolated neutron
starâ€”Calveraâ€”and H1504+65, the hottest white dwarf yet
discovered, with a surface temperature of 200,000 kelvin
```

â€¦and our module `example.js` contains:

```js
import retextEnglish from 'retext-english'
import retextReadability from 'retext-readability'
import retextStringify from 'retext-stringify'
import {unified} from 'unified'
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'

const file = await unified()
  .use(retextEnglish)
  .use(retextReadability)
  .use(retextStringify)
  .process(await read('example.txt'))

console.error(reporter(file))
```

â€¦then running `node example.js` yields:

```txt
example.txt
3:1-5:57 warning Unexpected hard to read sentence, according to 4 out of 7 algorithms readability retext-readability

âš  1 warning
```

The default target age is `16`.
You can pass something else, such as `6`:

```diff
   .use(retextEnglish)
-  .use(retextReadability)
+  .use(retextReadability, {age: 6})
   .use(retextStringify)
```

â€¦then running `node example.js` again yields:

```txt
example.txt
1:1-1:23 warning Unexpected hard to read sentence, according to 4 out of 7 algorithms readability retext-readability
3:1-5:57 warning Unexpected hard to read sentence, according to all 7 algorithms      readability retext-readability

âš  2 warnings
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is [`retextReadability`][api-retext-readability].

### `unified().use(retextReadability[, options])`

Check hard to read sentences.

###### Parameters

*   `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)
    â€” configuration

###### Returns

Transform ([`Transformer`][unified-transformer]).

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

###### Fields

*   `age` (`number`, default: `16`)
    â€” target age group
*   `minWords` (`number`, default: `5`)
    â€” check sentences with at least this number of words;
    most algos are made to detect the reading level on an entire text;
    this plugin checks each sentence on its own;
    for short sentences, one long or complex word can strongly skew the
    results
*   `threshold` (`number`, default: `4 / 7`)
    â€” number of algos (out of 7) that need to agree something is hard to read

## Messages

Each message is emitted as a [`VFileMessage`][vfile-message], with `source` set
to `'retext-readability'`, `ruleId` to `'readability'`, `actual` to the
difficult sentence, and `expected` to an empty array.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional type [`Options`][api-options].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line, `retext-readability@^7`,
compatible with Node.js 12.
